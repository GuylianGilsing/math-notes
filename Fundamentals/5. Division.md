# What is division?
TODO:: Add a definition here...

## Division as equal groups
Division can be seen as splitting a collection of items into **equal** groups.

```
[] [] [] []
[] [] [] []
[] [] [] []
[] [] [] []
```

The diagram above contains `16` items in total. If we would want to divide these items evenly, we would need to create `4` groups of `4` items in each group. This works because if we look at as a multiplication, we could ask ourselves which multiplication results in 16 and uses a `4`. In this case that would be `4 * 4 = 16`.

Our evenly divided items would look as follows:
```
[] | [] | [] | []
[] | [] | [] | []
[] | [] | [] | []
[] | [] | [] | []
```

but they could also look like this:
```
[] [] [] []
-----------
[] [] [] []
-----------
[] [] [] []
-----------
[] [] [] []
```

## Relating division to multiplication
When encountering a division like `48 / 8`, a multiplication could be used to find the answer. The division could be re-ordered into the following multiplication `? * 8 = 48`. In this example, the answer would be `6` since `6 * 8 = 48`.

# Dividing numbers by 10
When encountering a division like `40 / 10` we can solve it in two ways. The first way is to relate division to multiplication. We can ask ourselves "what times `10` makes 40?". In this case that would be `4 * 10 = 40`. The final answer would be `4` since `4 * 10 = 40` and we're asking how many times a `10` goes into `40`.

The second way of solving it is by understanding the pattern that dividing a number by `10` uses. The pattern comes down to removing a 0 from the number that you are dividing.

```
10 / 10 = 1
20 / 10 = 2
30 / 10 = 3
40 / 10 = 4
50 / 10 = 5
60 / 10 = 6
70 / 10 = 7
80 / 10 = 8
90 / 10 = 9
100 / 10 = 10
110 / 10 = 11
```
*This list displays the pattern that emerges when dividing all numbers greater or equal to `10` by `10`.*

## Understanding the pattern
We can use a place value system to understand why the pattern emerges.

When we divide the number `10` by ten, we see that it simply moves one place to the right inside the place value system.
