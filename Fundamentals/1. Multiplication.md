# What is multiplication?
Multiplication is the process of taking one number and adding it to itself a number of times.

## Multiplication as repeated addition
When you encounter yourself adding the same number over and over again, a nice little shorthand of writing it would be with the `*` symbol. This symbol indicates that a multiplication is taking place.

```
2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8
```
*Repeated addition*

```
2 * 4 = 8
```
*Repeated addition notated as multiplication*

## Multiplication using groups of objects
Multiplication comes in handy when you have to count multiple groups of objects. The diagrams below (diagrams `A`, `B`, and `C`) contain 3 blocks each.

```
A [] [] []

B [] [] []

C [] [] []
```

We can just repeatedly add these blocks together like `3 + 3 + 3`, but we can also write it down as `3 * 3`. 

## Multiplication order (commutative property)
The order in which you write a multiplication does not matter. `2 * 4` produces the same result as `4 * 2`.

When writing both of these multiplications down as repeated additions, we can see that they indeed produce the same answer.

```
(2 * 4) 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8
(4 * 2) 4 + 4 = 8
```
