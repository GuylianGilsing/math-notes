# What are fractions?
A fraction is simply a representation of **equal** parts inside a whole.

## Notation
A fraction is usually notated by two vertical components (numerator and denominator) separated by a line between them: $$\frac{1}{4}$$
The first component (or tap part) of the fraction is called a numerator. It indicates the **equal** parts that are being counted. The second component (or bottom part) of the fraction is called the denominator. It indicates the amount of **equal** parts in **one** whole.

Within this notebook, fractions are notated as follows:

```
2/3
4/4
1/4
2/2
```

Or written more abstractly:

```
numerator/denominator
```

The `/` symbol represents the separation between the numerator and the denominator.

## Proper fractions
Proper fractions are fractions where the numerator does not exceed the denominator. The following fractions are all proper:

```
1/2
4/4
8/10
4/7
9/9
```

## Improper fractions
Improper fractions are fractions where the numerator exceeds the denominator. These fractions are usually used to denote how many parts of a single whole are counted. The following fractions are all improper:

```
3/2
4/3
8/4
10/2
```

## Recognizing fractions
Since a fraction represents an amount of equal parts inside a whole, spotting them is quite easy.

### Inside highlighted diagrams
When spotting sections inside a highlighted diagram, the first thing to look for is that the diagram has been divided evenly. A fraction can't be formed when the diagram has not been divided evenly.

When the diagram is divided evenly, the next step is to count how many parts make up the whole. This is as simple as counting all parts of the diagram. This will leave you with the denominator. The numerator can be obtained by counting all highlighted parts.
