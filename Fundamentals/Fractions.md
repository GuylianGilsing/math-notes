# What are fractions?
A fraction is simply a representation of the amount of **equal** parts inside a whole.

## Notation
A fraction is usually notated by two vertical components (numerator and denominator) separated by a line between them: $$\frac{1}{4}$$
The first component (or tap part) of the fraction is called a numerator. It indicates the **equal** parts that are being counted. The second component (or bottom part) of the fraction is called the denominator. It indicates the amount of **equal** parts in **one** whole.

Within this notebook, fractions are notated as follows:

```
2/3
4/4
1/4
2/2
```

Or written more abstractly:

```
numerator/denominator
```

The `/` symbol represents the separation between the numerator and the denominator.

## Proper fractions
Proper fractions are fractions where the numerator does not exceed the denominator. The following fractions are all proper:

```
1/2
4/4
8/10
4/7
9/9
```

When thinking about fractions as numbers, a proper fraction is a number that stays between 0 and 1.

## Improper fractions
Improper fractions are fractions where the numerator exceeds the denominator. These fractions are usually used to denote how many parts of a single whole are counted. The following fractions are all improper:

```
3/2
4/3
8/4
10/2
```

When thinking about fractions as numbers, an improper fraction is the same as a proper fraction, it only exceeds past the limit of 1.

## Recognizing fractions
Fractions can be represented in many different ways. This section lists a few common representations and how to form fractions with them.

### Inside highlighted diagrams
When spotting sections inside a highlighted diagram, the first thing to look for is that the diagram has been divided evenly. A fraction can't be formed when the diagram has not been divided evenly.

The diagram below can be used to form a fraction since it has been divided evenly:

```
[] [] []
[] [] []
```

The diagram below can't be used to form a fraction since it hasn't been divided evenly:

```
[] [] [   ]
[   ] [] []
```

#### Proper fractions
This section uses the following highlighted diagram:

```
[x] [ ] [x]
[ ] [x] [ ]
```

When forming a fraction with an evenly divided diagram, the first step is to obtain the denominator. Using the diagram above, we can see that there are 6 pieces inside the diagram, thus our denominator is 6.

The second step is to see which parts inside the diagram are highlighted. We can see that 3 pieces are hightlighted, thus our numerator is 3.

The final fraction is `3/6`.

#### Improper fractions
**Warning**: This explanation is quite confusing and only exists because Khan Academy has this exact question inside their course.

```
// A
[] [] []
```
*Diagram A, this diagram represents one whole*

```
// B
[x] [ ] [X]

// C
[x] [x] [x]
```
*Diagram B and C, these two diagrams display the amount of highlighted sections inside the whole*

When forming a fraction, and multiple diagrams are shown that represent the parts of a whole, an improper fraction needs to be formed.

The first step is to form fractions based on diagrams B and C, this gives us `2/3` (diagram b) and `3/3` (diagram C). The last step is to add the numerators together while ignoring the denominators. This leaves us with the fraction `5/3`.

The formed improper fraction (`5/3`) represents how many pieces of the whole have been highlighted. It's because of this that we do not add the denominators together.
