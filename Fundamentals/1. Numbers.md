# What are numbers?
A number, in its most basic form, is a representation of a quantity. We can use numbers to count/keep track or calculate the quantity of a certain thing.

# Place value systems
We can use a place value system to have a specific number within a combination of numbers represent a certain amount.

When we have a number like `281`, we can break it down to display each number's value:

| Hundreds | Tens | Ones |
|-|-|-|
| 2 | 8 | 1 |

Representing a number like `201.105` can be done as follows:

| Hundred thousands | Ten thousands | Thousands | Hundreds | Tens | Ones |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| 2 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 5 |
