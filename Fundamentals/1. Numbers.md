# What are numbers?
A number, in its most basic form, is a representation of a quantity. We can use numbers to count/keep track or calculate the quantity of a certain thing.

# Place value systems
A place value system is nothing more than a simple table that lists each value of a number in a specific place. The following system represents a system that represents numbers between 1 and 1 million:

| HM | TM | M | HTh | TTh | Th | H | T | O |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |

The headers within the table represent a certain quantity. Each header has a specific code that indicates the name of the quantity:

- HM = **H**undred **M**illions
- TM = **T**en **M**illions
- M = **M**illions
- HTh = **H**undred **Th**ousands
- Tth = **T**en **Th**ousands
- Th = **Th**ousands
- H = **H**undreds
- T = **T**ens
- O = **O**nes

Within a place value the system, the highest quantities are on the left, and the lowest quantities are on the right. When we have a number like `281`, we can break it down to display each number's value:

| H | T | O |
|-|-|-|
| 2 | 8 | 1 |

Representing a number like `201.105` can be done as follows:

| HTh | TTh | Th | H | T | O |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| 2 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 5 |
