# What are numbers?
A number, in its most basic form, is a representation of a quantity. We can use numbers to count or calculate the quantity of a certain thing.

## Number systems
A number system is a system that can be used to express numbers in all sorts of ways. A computer, for example, uses a number system with only two numbers in it. When talking about number systems, the term `base` is used to indicate how many numbers that particular system uses. Since computers only use two numbers, `0` and `1`, it uses a base 2 system. Humans use a base 10 system. The base 10 system uses the numbers `0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`, `7`, `8`, and `9`. A combination of these numbers can be used to create larger numbers.

All these notes use the base 10 number system unless it's specified that a different system is being used.
